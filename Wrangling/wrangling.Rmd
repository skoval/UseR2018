# Data Wrangling

.cbox[
### Data wrangling refers to the process of going from messy data to data that can be analyzed.

# Goal of Tidying 

When _tidying_ our goal is to end up with a row-by-column structure of our data, that has clearly named variables and valid values.

# Common Steps with Data Wrangling

- Tidying

- Reshaping

- Selecting

- Mutating

---

# Tidyverse Toolbox

- `stringr`: String manipulation

- `tidyr`: For reshaping data

- `dplyr`: General data wrangling


---

# Tidying Unstructured Data 

--

- When scraping Web data, as we often do in sport, the data can be messy.

--

- It is typical to need some programming to get the data into a nice row by column structure

--

- String manipulation is a common task in this processed and can be tackled with the `stringr` package

---


# Example: Match Statistics

Recall the example tennis match where we scraped match statistics using `RSelenium`. The extracted data is in a single string, so it is unstructured and needs to be tidied up.

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=30)}
library(RSelenium) 

# Match statistics URL
url <- "http://www.flashscore.com/match/Cj6I5iL9/#match-statistics;0"

# Open driver
remDr <-remoteDriver(port = 4445L)

remDr$open(silent = TRUE)

remDr$navigate(url) # Navigate page

webElem <- remDr$findElements(using = 'id', "detail")

text <- unlist(lapply(webElem, function(x){x$getElementText()}))[[1]]

text
```

---

# What Steps Do We Need?

1. Identify the target structure (that is, variables and value types)

2. Split the string into the different variables

3. Extract values

4. Assign to variables in a data.frame

---

# Example: Goal Structure

We have a set of statistics for each player. One option is a long format with the following structure:


<br>

<div align="center">
<img src="match_stats_table.png" width=60%>
</div>


---

# Example: Splitting

```{r}
library(stringr) # Load stingr

str_split(text, "\n") # Split on return characters
```

---

# Group Data by Pattern

- Now that we have isolated some of the main elements of our data as a vector, we want to group data by type. 

- We can use pattern-matching to separate strings by their pattern

- Several useful `stringr` packages for pattern matching include:

--

<br>

```{r eval = FALSE}
str_detect(x, pattern) # Test each element for presence of pattern

str_subset(x, pattern) # Subset x by where pattern is found

str_extract(x, pattern) # Extracts first occurrence of pattern
```

---

# Regular Expressions

- By default, the `pattern` is assumed to be a _regular expression_.

- A *regular expression* describes a pattern in a string and is very powerful for pattern-finding. 

- Find more about `regex` in R [here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/regex.html)

# Example: Using RegEx to Sort Data

Looking at our example, we can separate the stats by using a pattern that finds elements with at least one lower-case letter for elements from the `Aces` to `Pre-match Odds`.

```{r}
split <- str_split(text, "\n")[[1]] # Save split vector

# Filter out extraneous elements

split <- split[(which(str_detect(split, "Aces")) - 1):
                 (which(str_detect(split, "Pre-match odds")) - 1)]

pattern <- "[a-z]"

stats <- str_subset(split, pattern) # Subset players and stat names

stats <- stats[!(stats %in% c("Service", "Return", "Points", "Games"))] # Remove headers
```

---

# Example: Using RegEx to Sort Data

We use exclusion to get all the other values

```{r}
values <- split[
	!str_detect(split, pattern) &
	!str_detect(split, "[A-Z]")
 ] # Get values
```

---

# Example: Structuring Data Frame

We notice that some stats have just counts while others have percentages and ratios. Suppose we only want to retain the percentages, we can do the following to isolate the percentage values using `str_replace`.

```{r}
values <- str_replace(values, "%.*", "")
```

---

# Long Format

We could organize our data in a long format by stacking all of the player stats on top of each other.

```{r}
match_stats <- data.frame(
  stat = rep(stats, each = 2),
  value = values,
  player = c("Player 1", "Player 2")
)

head(match_stats)
```

---

# Wide Format

We could create a wide format with a row for each player by using the `spread` function in `tidyr`.

```{r}
match_stats %>%
   spread(stat, value)
```

---

# Common Pitfalls with Sports Data

When working with sports data from the web, you should always be on the lookout for the following common problems with tidying data: 

- Need for date transformation
- Need for type conversion
- Misspelled or alternative names
- Missing values

---

# Example: Elo Ratings

Recall the Elo Ratings we scraped from the _Tennis Abstract_. Let's have a look at some of the issues above...

```{r warning = F}
library(rvest)

url <- "http://tennisabstract.com/reports/atp_elo_ratings.html"

page <- read_html(url)

# Use table class to extract Elo table
elo <- page %>%
    html_nodes("table.tablesorter") %>%
    html_table()

elo <- elo[[1]]
```

---

# Missing Data

There are several extraneous columns that crept in with the `html_table`. Let's remove these using pattern-matching on the column names. 

```{r}
elo <- elo[,str_detect(names(elo), "[A-Z]")]
```

---

# Type Conversion

If we look at the classes for each variable, we find that some Elo ratings are character when they should all be numeric. Let's use `mutate_at` from `dplyr` to convert these.

```{r warning = FALSE}
elo <- elo %>%
  dplyr::mutate_at(vars(Elo:Grass), as.numeric)
```

Note: Some true missing values are introduced.

---

# Question

Are there any peculiarities in the `Player` variable that we should be aware of? How would you find this out?

---

# Cleaning Names

- One of the most troublesome issues with sports data are inconsistent naming of players. This is a problem when you need to assign performance measures to the same individual, based on their name.


- Some of the "inconsistencies" you have to be prepared for are:

  - Misspellings
  - Differences in punctuation
  - Middle names
  - Multiple surnames
  - Abbreviations

---

# agrep

The `agrep` function performs approximate matching, and is a _very_ useful function for cleaning up names in sports data. It looks at the distance between the input `x` and a `pattern`, using the Levenshtein edit distance.

```{r eval = FALSE}
agrep(pattern, x, max.distance = 0.1, costs = NULL, ...) 
```

<br>

Most of the arguments are like the usual `grep` except for two: `max.distance` and `costs`.

`max.distance`: Numeric for the maximal distance

`costs`: Numeric cost for the Levenshtein edit distance

---


# Problem: Checking Names

1. Use `agrep` to inspect the `Player` variable in our Elo dataset.

2. Do you find any names that could be a problem for future analysis?

---

# Solution

It looks like one player has two different names in use.

```{r}
players <- sort(unique(elo$Player)) # Get unique players

approx <- lapply(players, agrep, fixed = T, x = players) 
# Compare each player against all others

players[sapply(approx, length) > 1] 
# Look for cases with multiple matches
```

---

# More Conversion

Our inspection of player names also finds that space is represented by a special character. To remove this, we can use the `str_replace` and the unicode representation for the space. 

```{r}
elo$Player <- str_replace(elo$Player, "\u00A0", " ")
```
